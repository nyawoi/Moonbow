# Moonbow Modding Library

## Introduction

Moonbow is a modding library for [Staxel](https://playstaxel.com/) that aims to facilitate the modding process, as well as provide greater access to the Staxel modding API.
It is not a mod by itself and makes no changes to vanilla functionality.

The library is currently in an experimental state, and its API is expected to change.
Feel free to experiment with it and create some basic mods, but do know the API is not stable.
If you have any questions regarding the API, or have some feedback or ideas, feel free to share them.

I hope you have fun making mods, and I hope this effort inspires creative minds to delve into the wonderful world of modding.

## Getting Started

Installation is done by subscribing to the [Steam Workshop listing](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2783945914), running the Staxel Content Builder, and allowing Moonbow's DLL installation.
This will copy the `Moonbow.Experimental.dll` file to the game's `bin` directory.
Simply reference the assembly in your next project and you're all set.

## Documentation

Documentation is pretty lacking, at the moment, with only [two articles](https://moonbow.aethar.net/articles/getting-started.html) written and most of the [public API](https://moonbow.aethar.net/api/index.html) being documented.
Once the API is finalized, expect more documentation, as well as a video tutorial series for modding Staxel in general.

### Community

Need some modding help?
